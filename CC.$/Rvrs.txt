Where energy can't be summoned at will:
Where there are permutations w/ energy in<out,
non-info input is required, to provide energy out,
perhaps bound to some energy.
That's called non-info supply.

Where energy can't be wasted:
Where there are permutations w/ energy in>out,
non-info output is required, to put energy.
That's called non-info exhaust.

This divides transput 2â†’4.

Where both apply, non-info, supply, can necessitate output.

There's A 2 square of whether A function is reversible in 2 ways;
info, & energy.

The quality of all permutations of same magnitude returning same result,
is called "magnitude symmetry".

All literals are both-irreversible.

By convention, info transputs are put 1st, in there respective groups.
That's called "the info-1st principle".
