Inversion pairs:
	Result tables that are each other's ~.
	They can be switched between by wrapping them in A "!".

In this format:
	Literals in order along diagonal,
	w/ extremes;
		top-left(minimum),
		bottom-right(maximum).

	All inversion pairs' lines, cross center, w/ = radius.
	Specific states are, on sides, between corners.
